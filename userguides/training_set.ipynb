    "## Material considerations\n",
    "The choice of settings you use is vasp are highly dependent on the material. Before starting consider the material properties, i.e. magnetic properties, and whether including of dispersion is needed. These will need to be set in the `INCAR` file during your calculations. Details of exact `INCAR` flags are not discussed here and more details can be found on the [vasp wiki](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/The_VASP_Manual).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, also consider if you want to include defects in your training set. For example, having a training set consisting of pristine structures and those with single vacancies present may result is a slightly higher error, but overall produce a better representative interatomic potential for looking at defect chemistry. In this case, you would do the following steps on the additional structures as well as the pristine."

    "\n",
    "**Structural file** - The `POSCAR` file contains the structural information. This contains the cell dimensions, list of species labels and number of each species, and a list of the x,y,z coordinates in either fractional or cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudopotentials** - The `POTCAR` file contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species used in the calculation. For more than one species the individual `POTCAR` files need to be concatenated into a single `POTCAR` files of the species, in the order the species appear in the `POSCAR` file i.e. if they are listed in the `POSCAR` as Li, Ni, O then the same order is needed in the `POTCAR`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling file** - The `KPOINTS` file contains the details for the Bloch vectors (k-points) that will be used to sample the Brillouin zone in your calculation. These can be specified in different ways. More details can be found on the wiki [KPOINTS](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/KPOINTS) page. This file is not always essential to the calculation as the [KSPACING](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/KSPACING) flag in the `INCAR` can be used instead. In this guide, the `KSPACING` flag is used in the `INCAR` in place of the `KPOINTS` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation details** - The `INCAR` file is the central input file for VASP and determines \"what to do and how to do it\". There is a large number of parameters which can be set here. This is where you set your calculation mode, such as the electronic relaxation conditions, ionic relaxation conditions, and of course, the settings needed for your specific material. Changes to the `INCAR` file for each stage of building the training set are discussed here.\n",

These setting are shown in the final two blocks headed with `---- <header> ----`. Just include the relevant block for each step. In addition to this, the final production run will need to run for a longer time period. This is done by changing `NSW`. For this example, in the production run `NSW = 10000`.\n",
